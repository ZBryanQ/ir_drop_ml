Image generation CNN?
Take several dimensional input (three images at once), try to filter into the correct output
Loss function is dependent on the similarity of the output to the IR drop map
What is appropriate loss function?
How does F1 score correlate with what we're doing? (is it just for the contest?)
How to appropriately generate the output image (using CNN, what is an efficient architecture
    needed to turn it into a image?) 

Handling images being different sizes?
rescaling with null values that can be postprocessed out?
scale up the size per pixel?

Netlist information?
What is a graph neural network anyways?
